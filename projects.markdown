<h4>Small Plastics in the Ocean’s Interior: coherent Analysis and Synthesis for better
Scrutiny (SPASS) (2026-2029)</h4> 
*Zhao S (JAMSTEC, Japan), Kvale K (ABOR, NZ), Galgani L (Uni. Siena, Italy), et al.*

SCOR funded working group to standardise data collection and analysis protocols for ocean microplastics.

<h4>The longevity of airborne microplastic-climate forcing from legacy plastic pollution (2023-2026)</h4>
*Revell L (University of Canterbury, NZ), Evangeliou N (NILU, Norway), Kvale K (ABOR, NZ)*

For this project we are estimating the potential radiative forcing for multiple scenarios of microplastic pollution and climate change over the next century using a combination of experimental and modelling methods.

<h4>Metal micronutrients: Major players in the Southern Ocean’s carbon sink. (2023-2026)</h4>
*Stirling C (University of Otago, NZ), Druce M (University of Otago, NZ), Bostock H (University of Queensland, Australia), Swann G (University of Nottingham, UK), Kvale K (ABOR, NZ)*

Here we are investigating the role of zinc, cadmium, and iron co-limitation on the efficiency of the biological carbon pump in the Southern Ocean over glacial cycles.
