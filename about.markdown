Aotearoa Blue Ocean Research is a fundamental and applied research consultancy with a focus on open ocean biogeochemical modelling. It is a registered research organisation in New Zealand and the European Union with a variety of contracts from both government and NGO sectors, and maintains collaborations with major international research institutes. I occasionally accept visiting students and host research projects, but cannot grant academic degrees. Since 2023 New Zealand is an Associated Country of Horizon Pillar 2, enabling my participation in some EU funding opportunities. Please get in touch if you want to discuss project ideas.
